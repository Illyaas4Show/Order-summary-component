- [Live Site URL](https://sage-kheer-d35d73.netlify.app)

## My process

- I structured the card with HTML, getting ready to use flexbox.
 - I used a list for the pricing section.
- I then added styling to the element and did the background.

### Built with

- HTML (semantic)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learn a little more about flexbox for example, how the justify-content and align-items work exactly. I think I should actually level up now lol.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - I had to review some of my knowledge here.
- [Ahmed Bayoumi](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Bayoumi-dev) - He helped me with the accessibility issues.
